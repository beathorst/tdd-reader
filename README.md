# Handout for workshops on Test-driven Development with TYPO3 CMS

In this repository, you can find the English and German handout for my
workshops on test-driven development (TDD) with TYPO3 CMS.

Find out more about the
[workshops I give](https://www.oliverklee.de/workshops/workshops.html)
on my home page (in German).

I am the maintainer of the
[PHPUnit TYPO3 extension](http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/phpunit),
which is available in the TYPO3 extension repository (TER).
